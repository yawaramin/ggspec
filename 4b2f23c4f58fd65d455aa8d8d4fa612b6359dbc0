One thing I discovered while writing this code is that right now if
there are any tests in the suite flagged as skipped, the output for
those gets displayed _first,_ before the output for the rest of the
tests--no matter what order they are defined in in the test source file.
This doesn't impact you if the order of your tests doesn't matter to
you--and order shouldn't matter to you because our philosophy is that
tests should be isolated from each other. But it is relevant when
testing the output of the runtime message functions.
